## Outline

- Threads are bad, should be replaced by blogs
  - Twitter started out as ‘micro blogging’ and has evolved into threads of 20 “micro-blog” posts stitched together.
  - Not truly permanent like blogs
  - Terrible UI for long-form content like this.
  - Only give Twitter your SEO and juice
  - Information is in one ear and out the other.
- With a blog you can sit and appreciate it as it’s isolated on its own. That’s a benefit, not a curse.
- With these twitter threads you feel like you’re learning, but you’re really not. It’s snapple cap web development.
  - Some are true, some aren’t. People don’t know which is which.
- Worse, it’s pushing incredible people in the industry away from creating courses we’d all benefit from.
- The harm

  - So much noise drowns out the good stuff

- Why do threads succeed?

  - It’s a shotgun approach to facts
  - It’s where people are.
  - It feels educational, so it makes the rest of your guilt-inducing scrolling feel _productive_. Which makes you feel better about sitting on the toilet scrolling for 57 minutes.

  - “Not All Threads”
  - Some have genuinely good information (which I’d argue should still live in a blog post)
  - These good few drive people to associate the thread emoji with value, giving threads a halo effect.
  - The relative rarity makes them stand out.
  - there is something to be said for putting it where people are
  - Higher effort tells people it’s high value = likes and shares
    - People are engaging solely to drive follower count.
    - People want to fill their page with things that will drive engagement.
    - We’re doing Twitter’s job for them, sacrificing our focus and self worth in the process.

- People who do this kind of “growth hack Tweeting” are getting hired at places like Google. It works for growing follower count, getting jobs, and making money.
- But it comes at a cost to the community. Threads have grabbed the collective microphone, said little of value, and refuse to give it up.
- Am I the guy shouting “Keep making those VHS tapes, Youtube courses will never catch on”? Probably.

- With Twitter’s paid features coming, will we see thread-based courses? I’d count on it. You’ve got auth, payment, video + image hosting, and comments already built in.

This being said, don’t be surprised if I make a thread or put out an ebook at some point. I’m no saint. I want to grow the things I’m working on, too. I just hope that I’m able to provide real value, not solely for the sake of growth.
