When I get into writing I generally fall into this pattern where I want the next post to be bigger and better than the last. I develop this idea that no one else is holding me to.

Part of it comes from chasing more numbers. More sign ups, more likes, shares , praise, etc. I wish I could say I was unaffected by other people's opinion of my work. I wish I could just care about the craft and write for the sake of it. That's the goal, really. Because when I chase numbers it ruins the writing. Because I want more feedback, I raise the bar on what is releasable. Every article that passes through bumps the bar a bit higher. The effort bar starts small and moves up with each publish. It's not entirely misguided. I am a person who wants to continually grow and improve, so making each article better than the last fits with that mindset, The big mistake is focusing more on product than process. If we compare it to exercise, we might spend an hour at the gym 3 times a week. As we improve , we don't spend 2,3,4 hours each day but increase the weight or speed or intensity of the session. I want to view my articles and writing as the process and put less on the publishing action, It's about spending an hour putting in the best you can on a daily basis. The writing improves when you practice it. When I go through and edit and revise it becomes better. That the bar that goes up. I become 1% better of a writer every day through that. My demos and insight improve as I learn more, and I learn through writing. So we need to lower the bar for what is acceptable. My friend Cassie Evans gave me this advice and it has helped so much. Writing, publishing, everything needs to have a higher frequency and lower bar.
