When I first learned of CSS custom properties, I immediately understood how handy they would be for defining colors and max-widths. We already had Sass variables for a while, and it was great only to declare colors in one place.

Lately, I'm discovering they're useful for so many more things. I'll run into a problem, only to find that CSS custom properties can provide a clean, concise solution.

Here are a couple of problems I recently faced. I'll show the potential solutions I thought through, then the CSS custom property solution I landed on.

## Spacing Components

For a website build, all of our components had equal spacing between them on a page. However, on some pages, the spacing between those same components was different.

### Potential Solutions

We could pass something to each component to tell them to change, either in the templating language or as a CSS class. But that would require adding code to every component so that they would prepare for the change.

Plus, the spacing size changes as the screen width shrinks, so that solution gets messy.

You could put a special class like `class= "small-spacing"` on the `<body>` or `<main>` element on the page, but again, each component would need to listen for it.

### CSS Custom Property Solution

Instead, if I set the spacing value to a CSS custom property, we're able to change it out on a per-page basis.

```css
:root {
  --large-component-spacing: 6rem;
  —small-component-spacing: 4rem;

  @media all {
    --large-component-spacing: 8rem;
    —small-component-spacing: 5rem;
  }
  @media all {
    --large-component-spacing: 12rem;
    —small-component-spacing: 6.25rem;
  }

  --component-spacing: var(--large-component-spacing);
}
```

On pages where we want to use the smaller size, we add a small style tag.

```html
<style>
  --component-spacing: var(--small-component-spacing);
</style>
```

This takes priority in the cascade, and this entire page is now spaced appropriately with one essentially one line.

## Changing Colors

Most of the site I'm working on has a white background, but then we added a page with a dark background. Suddenly components with black text and black lines needed a second state.

### Potential Solutions

The classic way would be something like this. (I'm still using CSS Custom Properties for the colors themselves here. I'm not a monster.)

```css
/* Declare the default colors */
.profile-card {
  padding: 2rem;
}

.profile-card__name {
  color: var(--gray);
}

.profile-card__tags {
  color: var(--gray);
  border: 1px solid var(--gray);
}

.profile-card__icon {
  fill: var(--gray);
}

.profile-card.white > .profile-card__name,
.profile-card.white > .profile-card__tags,
.profile-card.white > .profile-card__icon {
  color: var(--white);
  fill: var(--white);
  border-color: var(--white);
}
```

There's also the `inherit` keyword, which tells the browser to take the color from its parent element. It's an excellent method so you're not redeclaring your colors over and over. I really like it for making reusable SVGs, because you don't need to get specific with your CSS to change strokes and fills.

The issue with the `inherit` method is you need to be very aware of the element hierarchy, and if you rearrange the DOM, or declare a color in the middle of a cascade, this falls apart. It also takes more detective work to track down bugs.

### CSS Custom Property Solution

I think this solution is the most concise and clear to read and doesn't suffer the pitfalls of `inherit`.

```css
.profile-card {
  --main-color: var(--gray);
}

.profile-card.white {
  --main-color: var(--white);
}

.profile-card__name {
  color: var(--main-color);
}

.profile-card__tags {
  color: var(--main-color);
  border: 1px solid var(--main-color);
}

.profile-card__icon {
  fill: var(--main-color);
}
```

## Feedback

If you know of even cleaner solutions to these problems, I'd love to hear them! Reach out to me on Twitter or through the contact form here.

We aren't using CSS in JS on this site; otherwise, passing props would have been the solution to both of these issues.
