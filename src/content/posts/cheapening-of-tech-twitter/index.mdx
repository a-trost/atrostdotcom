I've been told by my friend Mike that this is rather... off-brand for me. Cranky Alex, I guess. I'll leave it up but keep it in drafts. I'm typically more positive and encouraging than this. Thumbs up, big hugs.

Twitter threads have exploded in the last year or so and are a sure-fire way to get a boat load of retweets and likes. The vast majority of threads that are designed as 'engagement magnets' are either lacking value, or would have been better as blog posts.

## Worse than Blogs

While most content feels like it has a short lifespan, I'd argue Twitter threads have a much shorter lifespan compared to blog posts or videos.

Twitter has a terrible interface for long-form content. Jamming a row of buttons between each paragraph isn't exactly a delightful way to read for most people.

With a blog you can sit and appreciate it as the content is all on its own. Unlike Twitter, the blog isn't trying to growth-hack your attention. That‚Äôs a feature, not a bug.

It's a _delight_ to read articles published on nice websites. [Josh Comeau](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/) and [Amelia Wattenberger](https://wattenberger.com/) are two I love reading, and they include elements that would be impossible in a Twitter thread.

Then there's SEO. You're trading your SEO juice to Twitter for likes and retweets. It's a short-term game.

Lastly, **code snippets**. I mean. Do I need to say anything else? _Code snippets_.

## The Snapple Cap Effect

There's a drink called Snapple that prints a 'real fact' on the bottom of every of their caps. One tells you a duck's quack doesn't echo, or that elephants only sleep for two hours a night. They're a lot of fun because you get to share them with your friends and you _feel like_ you've learned something.

[A whole bunch of them aren't true](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/10/we-fact-checked-snapples-real-facts/280512/).

The same thing happens on web dev Twitter. People will post a "cool JavaScript trick" in order to get shares, not minding that it's actually really poor advice. People will try to help and correct the Tweet, but it's too late.

You know what feature Twitter doesn't have that all blogs do? An edit button.

## Threads Feel Good

Like I said, the Snapple Caps _feel_ like learning, but you're not learning deeply. The same is true with most threads.

When you read a thread you take in the information, but it doesn't really stick, because you're not doing anything with it. We learn when we need to use our brains and expend some effort. If learning feels easy, it's probably not going to last too long.

If you see threads as educational it makes the rest of your doom scrolling _feel productive_. This relieves the guilt you felt for sitting on the toilet for 57 minutes. "I learned something," you announce proudly.

## Why Threads Succeed

Why else do threads succeed? There's something to be said for putting content where people spend most of their day, and dear god do we all spend too much time on Twitter.

People aren't likely to click a link to go to another page, and Twitter is less likely to surface links that take you from their platform. For that reason, the algorithm probably promotes threads more than links to blog posts.

The relative rarity makes threads stand out from the rest of the shower thoughts.

The fact that threads take more effort and planning than regular tweets implies that it has higher value. Cue the likes and shares.

They're also succeeding because so many of us are trying to 'win' at Twitter.

Twitter users are engaging solely to drive follower count. People want to fill their personal timeline with things that will drive engagement. People see a thread titled "10 things you need to know about GraphQL" and say "Ah, that's valuable content that I can share with my followers!"

## Hurting the Platform

Listen, I don't think tech Twitter is this _sacred place_ that's being defiled by threads. But just because it already sucks doesn't mean we need to make it worse.

Attention is a finite resource, and aiming it at empty content comes at a cost to the community. Like your drunk uncle at a wedding, threads have grabbed the microphone, said little of value, and refuse to give it up.

## "Not All Threads"

Sure, not all threads suck. There are definitely a lot that are pretty great, and they're generally just a collection of thoughts as something happens. Swyx does some wonderful threads, and I think it's the perfect medium for what he does. I've seen other people jsut shoot off quick "Things I love about Vue" or live-tweeting an event. These are all awesome.

Then there's some actual "üßµ" threads that have genuinely good information (which I‚Äôd argue should still live in a blog post). These good few drive people to associate the thread emoji with value, giving threads a halo effect.

This isn't a rallying cry against the _feature_ of Twitter threads. It's against the deluge of tweets that end with "üëáüßµ". Some are great, but most are "growth hacks."

## Wrap Up

Twitter started out as ‚Äòmicro blogging‚Äô and has since evolved into threads of 20 ‚Äúmicro-blog‚Äù posts stitched together. It feels incredibly backwards to invent blogs with extra steps and a shittier UI for reading long-form content.

Am I the guy shouting ‚ÄúKeep making those VHS tapes, Youtube courses will never catch on‚Äù? Probably. Could this be the next big way that we end up making content? Maybe, I mean Hank Green is killing it on TikTok so I guess anything's possible as a teaching medium.

With Twitter‚Äôs paid features coming, will we see thread-based courses? I‚Äôd count on it. You‚Äôve got auth, payment, video + image hosting, and comments already built in.

This being said, don‚Äôt be surprised if I make a thread at some point. I‚Äôm no saint. I want to grow the things I‚Äôm working on, too. I just hope that I‚Äôm able to provide real value, not solely for the sake of growth.
