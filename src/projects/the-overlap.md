The Overlap is a podcast I co-host that talks about Web Development and Graphic Design. We cover topics like typography, react, static sites, freelancing, and much more.

While it is largely one big collaboration, my co-Host and cousin Elle created the graphic assets while I made the site.

We wanted a bit more functionality than just linking out to the different podcast players, so we went with a single page React app created in Gatsby. I leveraged the speed that Gatsby brings to make the site exceptionally fast and enjoyable to develop.

We'll be covering a lot of different topics, so we wanted to make it easy for our listeners to find episodes about certain topics or terms. I implemented a search and tag filter to work together and make the user experience simple and fast.

We also wanted the user to be able to click into episodes without the player stopping the currently playing episode. As users click into different episodes, the content changes but the player never stops.

The biggest lift is making the podcast itself. We launched March 19th, 2019 and publish episodes every other Tuesday. Head to the site and subscribe in your podcast player of choice!
