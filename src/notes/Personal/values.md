# My Values

**Evidence based**. Believe things when there is evidence to believe them. Change your beliefs when the evidence calls for it.

**People over profits**. I’d much rather work for a company that values the way it treats people and affects the world over the money it makes.

**Build up others**. Don’t steal the spotlight, but point it towards friends and colleagues.

**Give credit**. Everything you do is on the shoulders of giants. If someone inspires you, say so. You’re more of an artist for borrowing from others, not less.

**Learn in public**. From [Swyx](https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public): Whenever possible, bring your learning into the light. Reveal your steps, ask questions, share your mistakes, and show your work.

**Do things that frighten you**. Being scared of failure isn’t a good reason to say no to something. Actors take roles that scare them because they know it’ll force them to grow.

**Always grow**. You’re an unfinished process. Push yourself to grow in some way every day. Small, consistent growth beats inconsistent spurts.

**Be grateful for what you are today**. Don’t glorify goals in the distance and wait for happiness. Appreciate what you are and what you have today.

**Automate and batch**. Save time and money, replicate success, and eliminate tedious busywork. Meal prepping is a great example. Look for opportunities to do something once instead of 30 times.
