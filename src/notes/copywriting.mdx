# Copywriting

These notes were taken during the [Skillshare Course _Copywriting For Beginners: How To Write Web Copy That Sells Without Being Cheesy_](https://skl.sh/2YUcNLR)

## What is Copywriting?

Writing words that inspire action.

- Buying a product or service
- Subscribe to something
- Just click a button

Learning to write for the web is a useful skill as everyone is competing for attention, so you need to stand out.

## Copywriting =/= Content Writing

Blog posts and landing page writing are two very different things.

Content writing is blog posts, articles, etc. Builds relationship, adds value, etc.

Copywriting is websites, landing pages, email campaigns, sales pages, funnels. It inspires action.

## Understanding the Audience

Knowing your audience is highly important.

50% of the time spent is spent in research, learning about your audience.

You can't influence someone if you don't understand them.

> Advertising people who ignore research are as dangerous as generals who ignore decodes of enemy signals.

-- David Ogilvy

Easier to sell to someone you know as you already have their trust and know what they like and desire.

Empathy is important for copywriting.

### Research Questionnaire

- Who is your target market?
- What problems are they experiencing right now?
- What benefits does your product or service deliver?
- How is your product or service better than the competition?

## How to Speak Your Audience's Language

Quick tip to get a read on your target audience:
Look at book reviews for books that relate to your target audience.

Find the best selling books in your category and read the reviews.

People will say why they purchased the book, the problems they had that made them want the book, what they want to learn, etc.

Amazon shows the most common words used in the reviews.

## 5 Tips for Writing for the Web

People behave differently online. People skim online much more than offline.

Write for scanners and scrollers.

> 79% of our test users **always scanned any new page** they came across; **only 16% read word by word**.
