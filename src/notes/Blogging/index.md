* Well-designed

Eric talks about posts that are high quality and bring a lot of traffic. He calls them **Pillar Posts**. I'm assuming that they hold up the rest of your content or blog, and this makes sense. You can see this in the web design world where Wes Bos will make a full, high quality course and give it away for free.

He then points out that this guy Neil Patel writes 4000+ word blog posts every two days. This part was less inspirational and more overwhelming.

* List Posts
* "How To" posts
* Roundup Posts


> "6 Steps to your first Content Marketing Plan"

This is a list post and he breaks up each step into smaller subheadings.

List posts are great because if I only find one section relevant, I can skip to that section and read just that part. It's easy to find, and if I set up the table of contents, it'll be even easier for readers to skim to.
